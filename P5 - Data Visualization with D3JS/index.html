                <h1>Thermic power produced by heat pumps</h1>
                <p>
                  Thermic pumps use electric power to exchange thermic energy between two thermo-vectors
                  flowing through the heat pump. The first is the ambient air present outside, and the other
                  is water, which flows into an internal circuit to carry the heating or cooling power into the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following charts we will consider only the internal loop of water flowing through the heat pump,
                    as simplified in the following schema.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The thermic power that the heat pump provides to the system is calculated as follows:
                </p>

                <pre>Thermic power [W] = (temp_o [C] - temp_i [C]) * flowrate [m3/s] * water_specific_heat [J/(m3*C)]</pre>

                <p>
                    Given that flowrate and water_specific_heat can be approximated as constants in our system, the thermic power
                    provided is proportional to the difference between temp_o and temp_i.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The charts show the input (temp_i) and output (temp_o) temperature of the water flowing through the heat pump. <br />

                  The area between temp_i and temop_o is coloured by the heating (red) or cooling (blue) thermic power provided.
                </p>

                <h2>Thermic power produced by "on/off" thermic pumps</h2>
                <p>
                  On/Off pumps are unable to modulate the compressor power.
                </p>
                <svg class="onOffChart"></svg>
                <p>
                    Thermic pumps are programmed to mantain the input water temperature (temp_i) between 10 and 14 degree C.
                    Since the thermic demand from the refrigerated area is lower than the thermic power provided by the heat pump,
                    the latest has to modulate its power by switching on when the temperature temp_i reaches 14 degrees C and off
                    when the temperature temp_i lowers below 10 degrees C.
                </p>

                <h2>Thermic power produced by "inverter" thermic pumps</h2>
                <p>
                    Inverter pumps are able to modulate the compressor speed, therefore its power.
                </p>
                <svg class="inverterChart"></svg>
                <p>
                    Inverter pumps are programmed to keep the temp_i temperature at 10 degrees C.
                    They use the maximum power (dark blue) to lower the system temperature until they reach the target 10 degrees.
                    Then they progressively lower the compressor power until they find the optimal power to keep the system in balance with temp_i of 10 degrees C.
                </p>

                <h2>Inverter vs On/Off</h2>
                <p>
                   Comparing two heat pumps of about the same maximum power, we can see that they have quite
                   different consumption pattern. They both provide a comparable amount of thermic power, but
                   inverter pumps have more stable output temperature and energy consumption.
