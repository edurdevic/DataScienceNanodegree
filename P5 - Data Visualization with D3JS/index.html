    <h1>Thermic power produced by a heat pumps</h1>
    <p>
      Thermic pumps use electric power to rise or lower the temperature of a thermo-vector (usually water).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following charts shows the water input (temp_i) and output (temp_o) temperature.
      The area between temp_i and temo_o is coloured by the heating (red) or cooling (blue) thermic power given from the heat pump.
    </p>

    <h2>Thermic power produced by "on/off" thermic pumps</h2>
    <p>
      On/Off pumps are unable to modulate the compressor power. To mantain the water temperature in a certain temperature range
      those pumps have to sitch on and off.

    <h2>Thermic power produced by "inverter" thermic pumps</h2>
    <p>
      Inverter pumps are able to modulate the compressor power.<br />
      Instead of going on and off, those pumps can lower the
